# Online-Judge
It is an Online Judge made in JSP which compiles the code by using Process class (GCC Compiler should be installed on local 
computer.). It has options for uploading files so problem setter can upload input and output test case files in his own PC. Then by 
selecting the appropriate C++ file (At this stage only C++ is supported.) and submitting it We can get different outputs Like 
Compilation Error, Runtime error or Accepted Code.
